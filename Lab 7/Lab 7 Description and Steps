Pinging Network Devices:
Step 1: not able to reach PC3, repeated errors when trying ping 10.1.1.2
Step 2: changed IP default routes
Step 3: Now able to ping PC3, although there was one packet timeout (rest were successful)
However, reaching PC2 (10.1.1.3) was much faster and more reliable

General Guide
1. Once GNS3 is opened and the sandbox interface is open, create a new router by:
	a. Click "New Template"
	b. Click manually create
	c. Choose Dynamips/IOS routers from the list on the left
	d. Choose "New" on the bottom
	e. Select the file from Home/Desktop
2. Drag and drop routers, switches, and PCs onto the sandbox to create them
3. Select the ethernet wire icon from the leftside toolbar to create connections between devices
4. To edit device configurations and assign IP addresses, double-click on the device to open its console

Description of Steps to Create Lab Topology
1. Create 2 PCs connected to an ethernet switch
2. Create 2 routers connected to each other, one to the switch and the other to a new PC3
3. Start R2 by right-clicking on the router and selecting start, and then open router console
4. Enter configuration mode and set interface f0/0 to 10.1.1.1 through these commands:
	i. config t
	ii. interface FastEthernet0/0
	iii. ip addr 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.0
	iv. no shut
	v. exit
	vi. exit
5. Ensure ip is assigned properly by using 'show ip interface brief'
6. Assign interface f0/1 on R2 to IP address 192.1.1.1 by following step 4
7. Assign interface f0/0 on R3 to IP address 192.1.1.2 by following step 4
8. Assign interface f0/1 on R3 to IP address 10.2.1.1 by following step 4
9. Start PC1, and assign the e0 interface to the IP address 10.1.1.2, and set the gateway to R2 by:
	i. Open PC1 console
	ii. ip 10.1.1.2/24
	iii. ip 10.1.1.2/24 10.1.1.1
10. Start PC2 and assign ip address 10.1.1.3/24 and gateway also to R2
11. Start PC3 and assign ip address to 10.2.1.1/24 and set gateway to R3
12. To let PC1/PC2 communicate with PC3, set R2 and R3's default routes to be each other
	i. Enter config mode on R2 and enter 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.1.1.2'
	ii. Enter config mode on R3 and enter 'ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 192.1.1.1'
13. You can now ping any PC in the network through R2 and R3
